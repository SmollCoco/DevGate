1. **Dashboard View**

    - There doesn't appear to be a dedicated dashboard component or view that centralizes all user data in one place.
    - The ProfileView has some of these elements but a comprehensive dashboard is not evident.

2. **Filtering of Timeline**

    - While the timeline displays different types of activities, there doesn't appear to be filtering functionality by activity type.

    - GitHub API integration to automatically fetch projects
    - Dev.to API integration
    - OpenAI API integration
    - Wakatime API for tracking coding time
    - JSON Resume API integration

4. **Stack/Technologies Used Tagging**

    - The project details don't include a way to tag multiple technologies used in a project.

5. **Automatic Progress Tracking**

    - The objectives have manual progress tracking, but there's no implementation for automatic tracking.
