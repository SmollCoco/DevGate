    - No implementation of graphical representations (charts/graphs) for:
        - Number of skills added per month
        - Time spent coding per week
        - Levels attained
        - Projects completed over time

3. **Filtering of Timeline**

    - While the timeline displays different types of activities, there doesn't appear to be filtering functionality by activity type.

4. **Advanced Integration with External APIs** (mentioned as bonus features)

    - GitHub API integration to automatically fetch projects
    - Dev.to API integration
    - OpenAI API integration
    - Wakatime API for tracking coding time
    - JSON Resume API integration

5. **Stack/Technologies Used Tagging**

    - The project details don't include a way to tag multiple technologies used in a project.

6. **Automatic Progress Tracking**

    - The objectives have manual progress tracking, but there's no implementation for automatic tracking.

7. **Time Tracking**

    - No feature to track time spent coding, either manually or automatically.
